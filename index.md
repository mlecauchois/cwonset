## "Predictions are hard, especially when it's about the future" - Jacques Chirac ðŸ•Š

Economical crisis, infant mortality, anocracy... When a civil war occurs in a country, retrospectively, one can say "of course this is happening, this country had so many major issues !". But which issues specially leads to civil war ? Is there more influent issues than others ? Are there pattern of certain issues to trigger civil war, some sort of evil secret sauce ? Can we avoid civil war by predicting it, and acting before the un-repairable ? That's what we will try to find out.

This is a hopeful blog: **can we predict when civil wars are bound to occur ?** Such events are profoundly destructive for the citizens of these countries, and their effects are now inevitably globalized. Predicting these conflicts early on presents a major challenge for policymakers in an effort for peace. By successfully doing so, the identification of potential causal mechanisms would unravel a world of possibilities when it comes to understanding and defusing these catastrophes.

This decade has seen the exponential use of machine learning techniques, deep learning in particular, in a broad range of areas. This renewed enthusiasm, in part triggered by the dramatic increase in data and computing power, has implications in the domain of the political sciences. In 2015, Muchlinski and colleagues released a study on the use of Random Forests, a machine learning technique well suited for the prediction of rare events: [Comparing Random Forest with Logistic Regression for Predicting Class-Imbalanced Civil War Onset Data](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24573207?seq=1). One of their findings was that this machine learning technique could rival with classical statistical methods in predicting civil war onsets, and brought some new insights into the emergence of these conflicts by analyzing the predictive power of the variables used.

In a similar fashion, our study aims at pushing this comparative analysis further, in the realm of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Since Random Forest algorithms are powerful at handling severe imbalance in the data to answer such questions, we wish to study if ANNs can do the same. If proven useful, ANNs could, for instance, enhance the prediction of rare events in conflict data by leveraging their high flexibility in input modality: be it temporal, linguistic or visual data. To motivate their use, we will focus on three different interrogations about these conflicts:

* Can we predict when they start ?    
* Does this prediction change throughout modern history ?
* Can we predict when they end ?

But before diving into the core of this study, let us ask ourselves:

## How much civil wars has the world seen ?

## Can we predict when they start ?




## Does this prediction change throughout modern history ?







## Can we predict when they end ?
